# Super-FNaF-Decompiled
Decompiled version of an old game Super FNaF. Contains all files, source code, sprites and .gex file needed to launch the game.

So, you idk why, but you want to explore and pirate an ancient free game. To launch it you need to have Standard GameMaker 8.1. I don't have it too, so to pirte this ancient shit, view tutorial here -> https://youtu.be/lqaxrZuo4fQ?si=n8Q16Yf2zJNQPwL_

If video becomes lost media, follow steps below (If mega link somewhy breaks, find my contacts somewhere below): 
1. Download files from here -> https://mega.nz/file/HRw1WSKQ#PFC_og0q8snEqBlaIUoipG9burJ88H5EEKC8eltz3vA
   (I had no problems, however I have no idea if it has viruses, so I recommend to use anivirus to be sure)
2. Unzip it
3. Install GameMaker 8.1 by launching GameMaker-Installer-8.1.140.exe
3.1. Open crack folder and copy Game_Maker.exe
4. Then close GameMaker (if it is opened) and go to \AppData\Roaming\GameMaker or use WIN+R and type %appdata%\GameMake
5. Paste (CTRL+V) and replace Game_Maker.exe
6. Nice! Now you (probably) have full version. For questions write me here ivanuick@gmail.com or https://forgotten-uncle-shrimp.itch.io/

Now if you launch the engine and open .gmk file you'll get error not found extension Caster or smth like this. To fix this shit, basically click GREEN + ont he top panel of engine and install Caster.gex from the folder in github, that you (maybe) downloaded and unzipped. 
Now you can launch, modify and launch and do whatever you want and launch, etc.

!IMPORTANT!
I have (and claim) no rights for the game. The author is Lylly from gamejolt -> https://gamejolt.com/@Lylly Shout out to him/her/them for such a cool game!
And I'm just an enthusiast and did it for fun.
